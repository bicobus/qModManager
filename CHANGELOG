**1.0.0-alpha10:**

    Same as alpha9, but working.

**1.0.0-alpha9:**

    * Send archives to the trashbin instead of a full removal from the hard drive.
    * Foundations for the internationalisation (l10n) of the software through gettext
    * A Watchdog to monitor both the module's repository and the game's module path
	    * The software will automatically add whatever archive dropped in the module's repository
	    * The software will automatically determine if the game's module directory has been modified and regenerate it's database the next time the application gain focus
	    * A checkbox exists to disable this behavior if unchecked.
    * Internal dev stuff: changes of libraries used, reworking codebase, etc
