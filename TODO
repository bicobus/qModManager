  [ ] Installing over a mismatched state doesn't refresh the other archives's states
      The mismatched state is properly erased from the item that override the existing files, however the other
      archives do not get their cache updated. This is due to the fact that the previous files aren't removed from
      the buckets.

Implement basic UI and features:
   [ ] Stylesheet: implement something like https://github.com/gmarull/qtmodern/blob/master/qtmodern/styles.py
   [x] Populate the list of managed mods @done (13-12-19 18:49)
   [x] Populate tabs appropriately @done (13-12-19 18:49)
   [ ] Merge existing tabs into a single tree view
       Color code each row to show the status of the files
   [ ] A "Refresh Archives" button might be helpful
       Refresh the list of archives present in the folder. Could be done
       automatically by watching changes to the folder.
       Known Qt way: QFileSystemWatcher https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfilesystemwatcher.html
       Investigate python.
   [ ] Normalize mismatched archive
       Provide a way to normalize an archive, by replacing the mismatched
       content with the one from the archive.

Toolbar:
  [x] actionOpen @done (20-10-19 10:40)
    Adds an archive to the list
    [x] actionOpen_done (callback) @done (09-12-19 12:57)
        Check if file isn't already in the list, both name and hashsum
  [x] actionRemove_file @done (20-10-19 10:47)
  [ ] actionHelp
  [x] actionAdd_Archive(clone of actionOpen) @done (20-10-19 10:41)
  [ ] actionAbout
  [x] actionSettings @done (13-12-19 08:32)

  [x] actionUninstall_Mod @done (13-12-19 18:45)
  [x] actionQuit(handled natively) @done (20-10-19 10:41)
  [ ] Double click to install/uninstall

Filehandler:
  Related to listing, extracting and parsing archives.
  [x] install_archive needs to refresh the state of the tracked files @high @done (31-12-19 06:05)
  [x] uninstall_files needs to refresh the state of tracked files @high @done (31-12-19 06:06)
      [x] qmm.widgets.ListRowItem.refresh_strings alone isn't sufficient @done (31-12-19 06:06)
          ConflictBucket needs to be regenerated.
  [x] uninstalling a mod doesn't remove empty directories @done (31-12-19 06:44)
      The whole tree should be passed along the matched files
  [ ] Have a way to build a list of files to extract from an archive. @high
      We need to only extract files recognized by the game. Currently .xml and .svg files. The remaining files should be set into a ignored list.
      The list of files to extract needs to be passed down to filehandler.extract7z, or have that function request the list by itself.
      [x] Build a list of ignored files from the archive @done (13-12-19 18:49)
  [x] Changes mod storage so that it isn't nested, see set_archive_as_managed @high @done (15-11-19 16:56)
  [ ] Allow standard folders instead of archives. @low
  [x] Refactor install_archive @done (28-11-19 18:57)
  [x] Refactor uninstall_archive @done (07-12-19 14:52)
  [x] Refactor delete_archive @done (07-12-19 14:52)
  [x] Refactor copy_archive_to_repository @done (11-12-19 12:21)

Metadata:
  [-] Unpack and store the metadata subfolder in the local repository. @high @cancelled (09-11-19 10:46)
      create a folder with the name of the archive, and in it a file whose name is the hashsum of said archive. If the hashsum changes, a new one will have to be created.
  [-] Provide a tool to the users for editing some metadata. @cancelled (09-11-19 10:46)
  [-] Garbage collect of old hash files @low @cancelled (09-11-19 10:46)
