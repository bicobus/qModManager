Implement basic UI:
   [ ] Stylesheet: implement something like https://github.com/gmarull/qtmodern/blob/master/qtmodern/styles.py
   [ ] Populate the list of managed mods
   [ ] Populate tabs appropriately

Toolbar:
  [x] actionOpen @done (20-10-19 10:40)
    Adds an archive to the list
    [x] actionOpen_done (callback) @done (09-12-19 12:57)
        Check if file isn't already in the list, both name and hashsum
  [x] actionRemove_file @done (20-10-19 10:47)

  [ ] Double click to install/uninstall

Filehandler:
  Related to listing, extracting and parsing archives.
  [ ] install_archive needs to refresh the state of the tracked files @high
  [ ] Have a way to build a list of files to extract from an archive. @high
      We need to only extract files recognized by the game. Currently .xml and .svg files. The remaining files should be set into a ignored list.
      The list of files to extract needs to be passed down to filehandler.extract7z, or have that function request the list by itself.
      [ ] Build a list of ignored files from the archive
  [x] Changes mod storage so that it isn't nested, see set_archive_as_managed @high @done (15-11-19 16:56)
  [ ] Allow standard folders instead of archives. @low
  [x] Refactor install_archive @done (28-11-19 18:57)
  [x] Refactor uninstall_archive @done (07-12-19 14:52)
  [x] Refactor delete_archive @done (07-12-19 14:52)
  [x] Refactor copy_archive_to_repository @done (11-12-19 12:21)

Metadata:
  [-] Unpack and store the metadata subfolder in the local repository. @high @cancelled (09-11-19 10:46)
      create a folder with the name of the archive, and in it a file whose name is the hashsum of said archive. If the hashsum changes, a new one will have to be created.
  [-] Provide a tool to the users for editing some metadata. @cancelled (09-11-19 10:46)
  [-] Garbage collect of old hash files @low @cancelled (09-11-19 10:46)
