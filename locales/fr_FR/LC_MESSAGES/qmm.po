"the\n"
"  ‘Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as\n"
"  ‘Executable Code as the case may be.\n"
"— ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the\n"
"  ‘Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This\n"
"  ‘Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the\n"
"  ‘Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;\n"
"  ‘this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country\n"
"  ‘mentioned in Article 15.\n"
"— ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.\n"
"— ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most\n"
"  convenient for people to study and modify.\n"
"\n"
"— ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and "
"which\n"
"  is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.\n"
"— ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or "
"communicates\n"
"  the Work under the Licence.\n"
"— ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under\n"
"  the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative "

"  the Work under the terms of the Licence.\n"
"— ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,\n"
"  renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making\n"
"  available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to "

"  essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal\n"
"  person.\n"
"\n"
"2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence\n"
"\n"
"The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\n"
"sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright\n"
"vested in the Original Work:\n"
"\n"
"— use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,\n"
"— reproduce the Work,\n"
"— modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,\n"
"— communicate to the public, including the right to make available or "
"display\n"
"  the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the "
"case\n"
"  may be, the Work,\n"
"— distribute the Work or copies thereof,\n"
"— lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,\n"
"— sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.\n"
"\n"
"Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether "
"now\n"
"known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.\n"
"\n"
"In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to\n"
"exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make\n"
"effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.\n"
"\n"
"The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage "
"rights\n"
"to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of\n"
"the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.\n"
"\n"
"3. Communication of the Source Code\n"
"\n"
"The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as\n"
"Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor\n"
"provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work\n"
"along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or "
"indicates,\n"
"in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a "
"repository\n"
"where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the\n"
"Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\n"
"\n"
"4. Limitations on copyright\n"
"\n"
"Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits\n"
"from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights "
"owners\n"
"in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable\n"
"limitations thereto.\n"
"\n"
"5. Obligations of the Licensee\n"
"\n"
"The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and\n"
"obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\n"
"\n"
"Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or\n"
"trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the\n"
"disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices "
"and\n"
"a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or\n"
"communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry "
"prominent\n"
"notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of "
"modification.\n"
"\n"
"Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the\n"
"Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will "
"be\n"
"done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence\n"
"unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version "
"of\n"
"the Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee\n"
"(becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or "
"conditions\n"
"on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the\n"
"Licence.\n"
"\n"
"Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates "
"Derivative\n"
"Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed\n"
"under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done\n"
"under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,\n"
"‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached "
"to\n"
"this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible "
"Licence\n"
"conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of "
"the\n"
"Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n"
"\n"
"Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the\n"
"Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code "
"or\n"
"indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available\n"
"for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the "
"Work.\n"
"\n"
"Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade\n"
"names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as "
"required\n"
"for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\n"
"reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n"
"\n"
"6. Chain of Authorship\n"
"\n"
"The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work "
"granted\n"
"hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has "
"the\n"
"power and authority to grant the Licence.\n"
"\n"
"Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she\n"
"brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/"
"she\n"
"has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n"
"\n"
"Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent\n"
"Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under "
"the\n"
"terms of this Licence.\n"
"\n"
"7. Disclaimer of Warranty\n"
"\n"
"The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous\n"
"Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects "
"or\n"
"‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.\n"
"\n"
"For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’\n"
"basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including\n"
"without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, "
"absence\n"
"of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property\n"
"rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\n"
"\n"
"This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a\n"
"condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n"
"\n"
"8. Disclaimer of Liability\n"
"\n"
"Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to "
"natural\n"
"persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or "
"indirect,\n"
"material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of "
"the\n"
"use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of "
"goodwill,\n"
"work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any "
"commercial\n"
"damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\n"
"damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product "
"liability\n"
"laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n"
"\n"
"9. Additional agreements\n"
"\n"
"While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional\n"
"agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.\n"
"However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and "
"on\n"
"your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any "
"other\n"
"Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each\n"
"Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted "
"against\n"
"such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional\n"
"liability.\n"
"\n"
"10. Acceptance of the Licence\n"
"\n"
"The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I\n"
"agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this "
"Licence\n"
"or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the "
"rules\n"
"of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and "
"irrevocable\n"
"acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and\n"
"conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this\n"
"Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative "
"Work\n"
"or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n"
"\n"
"11. Information to the public\n"
"\n"
"In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of\n"
"electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the "
"Work\n"
"from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a\n"
"website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by "
"the\n"
"applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be\n"
"accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.\n"
"\n"
"12. Termination of the Licence\n"
"\n"
"The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically "
"upon\n"
"any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination\n"
"will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work "
"from\n"
"the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full\n"
"compliance with the Licence.\n"
"\n"
"13. Miscellaneous\n"
"\n"
"Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete\n"
"agreement between the Parties as to the Work.\n"
"\n"
"If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under "
"applicable\n"
"law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as "
"a\n"
"whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make "
"it\n"
"valid and enforceable.\n"
"\n"
"The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new "
"versions\n"
"of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is "
"required\n"
"and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the\n"
"Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique "
"version\n"
"number.\n"
"\n"
"All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European "
"Commission,\n"
"have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version "
"of\n"
"their choice.\n"
"\n"
"14. Jurisdiction\n"
"\n"
"Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\n"
"— any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising\n"
"  between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as "
"a\n"
"  Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the "
"Court\n"
"  of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the "
"Treaty\n"
"  on the Functioning of the European Union,\n"
"— any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the\n"
"  interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive\n"
"  jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or "
"conducts\n"
"  its primary business.\n"
"\n"
"15. Applicable Law\n"
"\n"
"Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\n"
"— this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member "
"State\n"
"  where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,\n"
"— this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no "
"seat,\n"
"  residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.\n"
